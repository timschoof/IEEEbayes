### Background

Speech Reception Thresholds (in noise) using IEEE sentences. 

Two groups: 

- young adults without much noise exposure history
- middle-aged adults with quite a bit of noise exposure history

Four conditions (2x2): 

- two stimulus levels (40 and 80 dB SPL)
- either both the target and background noise were diotic (N~0~S~0~), or the target signal was inverted in polarity in one ear (N~0~S~$\pi$~) leading to a phase disparity across the ears

### The data

uLevs = mean SNR (i.e. SRT) <br />
sdLevs = standard deviation SNR

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# read in data
iee <- read.csv(here("IEEEsummaries.csv"),header = TRUE)

# turn dB SPL variable into a factor
iee$dBSPL <- as.factor(iee$dBSPL)
# create group variable
iee <- iee %>%
  mutate(group = paste0(substr(listener,1,1))) %>% 
  mutate(group = fct_rev(as.factor(group))) %>% 
  select(listener, group, dBSPL, manipulation, uLevs, sdLevs)

head(iee)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# plot SRTs
group.labs <- c("Young", "Middle Aged")
names(group.labs) <- c("Y", "M")

iee %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(manipulation), y = uLevs, colour = dBSPL)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ group, 
             labeller = labeller(group = group.labs)) +

  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("inverted" = expression("N"[0]*"S"[pi]), "none" = expression("N"[0]*"S"[0]))) + 
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Level (dB SPL)"))
```

### Bayesian analysis

#### Step 1: Begin with an "empty" model with varying intercepts

Questions:

* Should I standardize the outcome measure as well as the predictors?
* How should I assess the model at this stage?

I am creating an index variable for the listener variable. Note that I am not standardizing the outcome variable, instead I will specify the priors in dB.

Based on my PhD data (IEEEs in steady-state and amplitude modulated speech-shaped noise for young and older adults), I expect the overall mean to be -5 dB and the sd to be 1.5 dB.

```{r}
d <- iee %>% 
  mutate(uLevs = uLevs) %>% 
  mutate(listener = as.numeric(listener))
```

Specify the model as follows: 

SRT ~ Normal(mu, sigma) <br />
mu = a[listener] <br />
a[listener] ~ Normal(a_bar, a_sigma) <br />
a_bar ~ Normal(-5,1.5) <br />
a_sigma ~ cauchy(0,1) <br />
sigma ~ cauchy(0,1) <br />

Question: 

* Why would you use a half-cauchy distribution as opposed to an exponential or half-normal? I've heard that the cauchy distribution assumes medium-large effects, not small ones.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify varying intercept only model
brms_fmla <- brmsformula(uLevs ~ (1 | listener))

# specify priors
priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(-5,1.5)",  class = "Intercept"),
  set_prior("cauchy(0,1)",  class = "sd"),
  set_prior("cauchy(0,1)",  class = "sd", coef = "Intercept", group = "listener")
)

# compile and run model
prior_only.mod <- brm(
  brms_fmla,
  data = d,
  family = "gaussian",
  prior = priors,
  inits = 0,
  iter = 2000,
  warmup = 1000,
  chains = 2,
  cores = 2,
  sample_prior = "only",
  seed = 42,
  control = list(max_treedepth = 10,
                 adapt_delta = 0.8)
)

save(prior_only.mod, file = here("prior_only.RDATA"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here("prior_only.RDATA"))
summary(prior_only.mod)
```

Questions:

* How would I go about interpreting this? 
* Would I need to look at any of this at this stage, or would I just do a prior predictive check and plot the results?

```{r, fig.cap="Prior predictive check: density plot showing priors (yrep) and SRTs (y)."}
# prior predictive check
ppc_dens_overlay(y = as.vector(d$uLevs), 
                 yrep = t(predict(prior_only.mod, draws=25)[,1])
                 )
```

This looks reasonable. It's not perfect, but it's a prior, it doesn't need to be. The data can do the rest. At least this is in the right ballpark, suggesting I didn't do something obviously stupid (yet). 

#### Step 2: Start adding predictor variables

Let's start building the model up a bit more by adding predictor variables. I will standardize predictors and create index variables.

Predictors:

* manipulation: the effect of inverting the polarity of the speech across the ears. The difference between the two conditions (inverted and not inverted) is the binaural intelligibility level difference (BILD)
* dBSPL: the stimulus level (40 or 80 dB SPL)
* group: young or middle-aged

Create an index variable for the 'manipulation' variable, where 'none' (i.e. not inverted) = 1, and 'inverted' = 2.  

We will need to come up with a better estimate for the prior, based on the literature, but for now I'll just assume an effect of 'manipulation' (i.e. BILD) of 3 dB with a standard deviation of 1 dB. Since 1 = none, and inverted = 2, I will use a negative mean, because SRTs are expected to decrease (i.e. improve) when the polarity of the speech is inverted in one ear. 

Question:

* Should I create an index variable for the dBSPL variable (it only has two levels, so they are like ordered categories), or shall I standardize it (underlyingly it's a continuous predictor)?

For now I have decided to create an index variable for the dBSPL predictor since there are only two levels. 40 dB SPL = 1, 80 dB SPL = 2. I'm guessing that the effect of stimulus level is going to be 3 dB, with performance improving at higher levels. Therefore, the prior has a mean of -3 dB.

I'm creating an index variable for group, where 'young' = 1, and 'middle-aged' = 2. I expect SRTs to be higher (i.e. poorer) for the middle-aged group, so I'm specifying the prior with a positive mean. I'm just guessing at this point that the effect is going to be pretty small, say 1 dB.


```{r}
d <- iee %>% 
  mutate(listener = as.numeric(listener)) %>%  
  mutate(manipulation = as.numeric(fct_rev(as.factor(manipulation))),
         dBSPL = as.numeric(dBSPL),
         group = as.numeric(group))
```

Specify the model as follows: 

SRT ~ Normal(mu, sigma) <br />
mu = a[listener] + bM * manipulation + bdB * dBSPL + bG * group <br />
a[listener] ~ Normal(a_bar, a_sigma) <br />
a_bar ~ Normal(-5,1.5) <br />
a_sigma ~ cauchy(0,1) <br />
bM ~ Normal(-3, 1) <br />
bdB ~ Normal(-3, 1) <br />
bG ~ Normal(1, 1) <br />
sigma ~ cauchy(0,1) <br />

To figure out:

* Add interactions 
* Add random slopes
* Could I use measurement error (SD) for IEEEs in my model? I've seen something like this in the Statistical Rethinking book

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify varying intercept & manipulation effect model
brms_fmla <- brmsformula(uLevs ~ manipulation + dBSPL + group + (1 | listener))

# specify priors
priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(-5,1.5)",  class = "Intercept"),
  set_prior("normal(-3,1)",  class = "b", coef = "manipulation"),
  set_prior("normal(-3,1)",  class = "b", coef = "dBSPL"),
  set_prior("normal(1,1)",  class = "b", coef = "group"),
  set_prior("cauchy(0,1)",  class = "sd"),
  set_prior("cauchy(0,1)",  class = "sd", coef = "Intercept", group = "listener")
)

# compile and run model
full.mod <- brm(
  brms_fmla,
  data = d,
  family = "gaussian",
  prior = priors,
  inits = 0,
  iter = 5000,
  warmup = 2000,
  chains = 4,
  cores = 4,
  sample_prior = TRUE,
  seed = 42,
  control = list(max_treedepth = 10,
                 adapt_delta = 0.8)
)

save(full.mod, file = here("fullModel.RDATA"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here("fullModel.RDATA"))
summary(full.mod)
```

Questions:

* Am I interpreting this correctly?
* What's the difference between Family specific parameters and group-level effects? 
* What does the population-level intercept refer to?
* What other things should I look at in this table? Rhat looks ok.

`Group-level effects: sd(Intercept)`: remaining unexplained variability among participants? This has changed quite a bit compared to the intercept-only model.
`Population-level effects`: I'm not sure what the intercept refers to here anymore. It's not the overall mean. Presumably the others are the effects of polarity inversion (manipulation), stimulus level (dBSPL), and group.

#### Step 3: Visualize the results

Questions:

* How do I evaluate the model?
* What should I visualize?

I'm not entirely sure what to visualize exactly, so I'm just trying a few things that seem sensible.

First, let's see what's in this model.

```{r}
get_variables(full.mod)
```

Next, let's turn this into a sensible data frame for plotting. <p style="color:red"> Wait, I don't think I'm actually using this data frame! What format should the data be in?</p> 

```{r}
full <- full.mod %>%
  spread_draws(b_Intercept, b_manipulation, b_group, b_dBSPL, r_listener[listenerID,term]) 
  
head(full)
```

Let's start with plotting the results that we looked at before in table form (the population level effects).

I'm going to start with creating a data fram that combines the data and the draws from the posterior fit. 

Question:

* Is there an easy way to go from the indexed variables back to the original values?

```{r}
# 
draws <- d %>%
  modelr::data_grid(listener, manipulation, dBSPL, group) %>%
  add_fitted_draws(full.mod) %>% 
  select(-.chain, -.iteration) 

head(draws)
```

Questions:

* What should I look at?
* How should I plot it? My plots can definitely be improved.
* Should I just look at the effects or also at the individuals?

'Let's plot the posterior draws (What's this called?) for the two groups, where 1 = young, 2 = middle-aged:

```{r}
draws %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = .value, y = group)) +
  stat_halfeyeh()
```

For the two manipulation conditions, where 1 = none, 2 = inverted:

```{r}
draws %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = .value, y = manipulation)) +
  stat_halfeyeh()
```

Stimulus level, where 1 = 40 dB SPL, 2 = 80 dB SPL: 

```{r}
draws %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = .value, y = dBSPL)) +
  stat_halfeyeh()
```

Other things I'd like to look at:

* Difference between groups, manipulations, stimulus levels. Not sure how to plot that. The data frames are a pain to manipulate for some reason.
* Whatever I need to do for a proper posterior check. Can / should I plot things with the data?


Another thing I've seen being plotted, but I'm not sure what it means:
```{r}
pairs(full.mod,
      off_diag_args = list(size = 1/5, alpha = 1/5))
```

And I figured, let's look at WAIC and LOO, without really knowing what to do with it:
```{r}
full.mod <- add_criterion(full.mod, c("waic", "loo"))

full.mod$waic
full.mod$loo
```

A separate question is whether the model ran correctly. Let's visualize the chains.

```{r}
# extract the posterior samples
post <- posterior_samples(full.mod, add_chain = T)
# plot the traces
mcmc_trace(post, regex_pars = "b_")
```

This looks good, nothing crazy going on.

### More questions

* Anything else I should be doing? Or something I shouldn't be doing?
* How would I best explain the difference in inference between Bayesian and frequentist stats?
* What if you have unequal number of measures per participant, partly on purpose, because you decided to rerun a test occasionally? I think that's fine, the multilevel model will deal with that. My collaborator wants to compute a median across multiple measurements.
* Are there fewer assumptions because you can just model things the way you want?
* What do you do with outliers? Check something in WAIC or LOO or something?
* What do you do with missing data? Bayesian imputation?
